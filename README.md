===============

My attempt at making an FPGA add-on cape for the Beaglebone.

Right now the schematics in this repository are not correct. I had 
(still have) mostly poor revision control/backup discipline and lost a 
couple weeks worth of work on the schematics. Thankfully, the netlist 
and pcb design were untouched, and are included here. 

Right now I am shopping around to have this made. It has been reviewed 
by a few people, and I'm mostly confident it will work.
