My attempt at making an FPGA add-on cape for the Beaglebone.

Finding an affording manufacturer has been difficult, due in large part 
to weird thigns with my board design. Thankfully, I have found a great 
one that is working with me to clean up my design. After reviewing my 
design, they have submitted a list of improvements I should make. I am 
currently working my way down that list. I expect it will take most of 
this week. Then, it's off again to see if its ok, and whether it's 
affordable to build.

Right now the schematics in this repository are not correct. I had 
(still have) mostly poor revision control/backup discipline and lost a 
couple weeks worth of work on the schematics. Thankfully, the netlist 
and pcb design were untouched, and are included here. 

Right now I am shopping around to have this made. It has been reviewed 
by a few people, and I'm mostly confident it will work.
